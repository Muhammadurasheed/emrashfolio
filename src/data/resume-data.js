    title: "Healthify - Heart Stroke Prediction using Machine Learning and Fitness Trackers",
    text: `• Objective: Developed an AI-driven solution to predict and alert users of potential heart strokes using real-time data from fitness trackers.
• Data Collection: Utilized Mi Band 4 to collect longitudinal heart rate and blood pressure data, integrated with Mi Fit’s API.
• Machine Learning: Implemented and compared various algorithms (Random Forest, Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Tree) to predict stroke risk based on user metrics (age, gender, BMI, work type, heart rate, etc.).
• Deployment: Deployed the machine learning model on Amazon SageMaker for real-time predictions.
• Mobile App Development: Created a Flutter-based app to provide users with real-time alerts, emergency SOS features, and health data tracking.
• Features:
  o User Registration & Login: Secure account management and password recovery.
  o Home Screen: Real-time vitals display and health alerts.
  o Stroke Risk Prediction: AI-powered risk analysis with visual indicators.
  o Emergency SOS: Automated alerts to emergency contacts and nearby hospitals during critical events.
  o Health Data History: User access to previous health data and risk comparisons.
  o Language Translation: Multilingual support for diverse users.
  o Medical Contacts: Easy access to nearby medical professionals.
  o Health Tips: Guidance on maintaining a healthy lifestyle.
• Impact: Aimed to provide timely alerts for stroke risk, enabling quicker emergency responses and improving user outcomes.`,
